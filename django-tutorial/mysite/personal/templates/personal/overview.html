	<h3>It is the year 2032. The human civilization has been wiped out by rapid climate change. The earth looks vastly different from how it did just ten years earlier. Plants and vegetation have grown unchecked due to the increase in temperatures, creating a world that resembles a wide and vast forest. The only creatures that remain are Rabbits, Owls, and Foxes, which have expanded rapidly in their numbers. Oppressed by the Owls and Foxes, the Rabbit population is forced to live underground, coming up only to gather food. A dangerous and risky task, only the male Rabbits venture up.<h3>
